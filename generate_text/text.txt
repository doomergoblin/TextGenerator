
I'm walking down an alleyway, the only living soul around. It's the shortest night of the year and I have this tune playing in my head, I feel it in my body. Little spiders walking up and down my limbs. I'm exhausted, my ice-filled backpack is weighing down on me. The people strolling down this backstreet are like me, filled with fear. The way I fear them, they fear the light. Sometimes I wonder whether anything I'm experiencing is real.
Snow falls onto my face, in fact it has been snowing for the past two days. It's cold, I'm starting to go crazy.
All I want is to sleep, regain my sanity. I want the people around me to leave. But instead of shadows vanishing, I can see blue blinking lights appearing. A siren goes off. The snow is starting to melt in the rising summer sun and a police officer is telling me to freeze. Why does he use that word? Does he know?
